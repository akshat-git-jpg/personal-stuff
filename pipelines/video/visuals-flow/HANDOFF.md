# visuals-flow handoff (2026-07-18, post avatar-pilot session)

For the next session picking this up. Everything below was true and verified on
2026-07-18 (late night). Read PIPELINE.md first if you have never seen this
pipeline; read this doc for where things actually stand and what is open.
**Operate this flow via the `visuals-flow` skill (verb router) — landed as
plan 081.** The avatar shot-plan machinery (plans 077–080) is LANDED and the
test-01 pilot ran the same night — see "Immediate state of test-01" for what's
still in flight.

## What this is

Beat-synced motion graphics for final-workflow videos. One VO mp3 in, a folder
of rendered clips plus an editor manifest out. Graphics reveal their content at
the exact second the voiceover speaks each point. One LLM call per video;
everything else is scripts. Design spec: `docs/specs/2026-07-17-motion-graphics-beat-sync-design.md`.
Decisions log entries: decisions.md 2026-07-17 and 2026-07-18.
Caller contract for other pipelines: `INTEGRATION.md`.

## State: proven end to end

- **The full flow ran on real content**: test-01, a 32-min "5 AI video tools"
  comparison (`videos/test-01/`). 010 transcribe → 020 cue pass (Sonnet) →
  030 resolve → 040 owner board review (two feedback rounds, all folded) →
  050 render: **18/18 clips rendered 2026-07-18, ffprobe-verified,
  `manifest.md` written, owner-approved.** Pending only: hand `renders/` +
  `manifest.md` to the human editor and collect their reaction (feeds GFX-06).
- **010 transcribe**: Groq whisper-large-v3-turbo fast path (22s for 32 min,
  correct brand spellings), local whisper fallback. Accepts vo.mp4/mov/mkv/m4a/
  wav, extracts vo.mp3 itself, slug-or-path arg. NOTE: test-01's transcript is
  from the LOCAL engine with garbled names ("Heigen"); anchors quote the
  garbles verbatim by design — leave test-01's transcript alone.
- **020 cue pass**: prompt = `steps/020-cue-pass-llm/cue-pass-prompt.md` +
  catalog + transcript. Convention since plan 076: the final LLM output is
  snapshotted to `cues.llm.json` (committed, immutable) BEFORE owner edits —
  `lib/edit-delta.mjs` diffs it against the approved cues.json at fold time.
  Fix-loop: resolve + lint, errors fed back, ≤3 rounds (020 README).
- **030 resolve + lint**: anchor matching, schema validation, non-adjacent
  fullframe overlap, cursor past whole anchor phrases. `lib/lint-cues.mjs`
  machine-enforces the rubric: stat-hit cap/spacing, repetition cap
  (structural cards exempt — see catalog `structural: true`), exclusion zones
  as errors; density cadence/count/word-count as warnings.
- **040 board** (localhost:4322, binds 127.0.0.1, walks ports when taken):
  full-script timeline, live card previews, per-block feedback boxes with the
  full lifecycle (`{text, added, context, applied?, folded?}` — folded items
  are read-only history; unload warns on unsaved feedback), lint results in
  the Save banner (dismissable), DOM-overflow badges on tiles, `/calibrate`
  page rendering every beat card at its declared caps. Save resets `approved`
  when cues actually change (key-order-insensitive compare).
- **050 render**: refuses unapproved (`--force` to override) or stale
  `resolved.json`; staged per-cue renders (data-duration rewrite in a temp
  copy — the ONLY way to set duration), mp4 fullframe / transparent mov
  overlay, ffprobe duration checks, `manifest.md` derived from files on disk
  (so `--only` re-renders never clobber it), pinned hyperframes version.
- **060 feedback-fold** exercised twice on 2026-07-18: 9 owner items captured →
  applied to test-01 AND folded into rules (see TESTS.md "Folded lessons" +
  "Convergence"). Pre-flight: `node lib/feedback-status.mjs` exits 1 while any
  item is unprocessed — run it before ANY new cue pass.
- **card-library**: 42 cards, 11 beat cards. persona-match rebuilt as the
  finale card (gold winner chips); section-counter-scale gained an optional
  logo slot; ALL logos render muted per DESIGN.md's "Tool logos" rule
  (saturate .5, small); section openers carry `structural: true`.
- **070 shot pass** (avatar phase, landed 2026-07-18): after cue approval,
  an LLM pass proposes full-screen avatar spans (`shots.json`, anchored like
  cues; snapshot `shots.llm.json`). `lib/resolve-shots.mjs` + `lib/lint-shots.mjs`
  enforce: ≤300s TOTAL full-screen (E4, no force bypass — the owner's hard
  5-min HeyGen 4 rule), no fullframe-card collisions (E2), ≥12s spans (E3),
  U-curve (W3) and ≤300s host-less cadence gaps (W4 — owner rule, see the
  step's RULEBOOK Learnings row).
- **Board shot lane**: separate labeled minimap lanes (graphics / avatar) with
  a color legend — orange fullframe, sky-blue overlay, violet avatar; shot
  blocks are editable JSON + feedback boxes; "Approve graphics" and "Approve
  shots" are separate gates (owner questioned, then kept: one review sitting,
  two flags — editing cues auto-un-approves shots).
- **080 avatar render**: submit + download verbs over the heygen-web CLI
  (HeyGen 3 templates only; `engineMode: "test"` is the only implementable
  mode — production/HeyGen 4 is a validation error until the owner flips it).
  tp-1 anti-ban pacing, idempotent `avatar-jobs.json`, one-attempt downloads,
  `avatar-manifest.md` (separate from manifest.md on purpose — render.mjs
  rewrites that from disk). `--spans-only` skips the corner track.

## Where the rules live (five surfaces)

1. `steps/020-cue-pass-llm/RULEBOOK.md` + `cue-pass-prompt.md`: selection
   judgment (density, routing, structural consistency, step-narration,
   pricing consolidation, caps, anchors, brand spelling). Edit BOTH together.
2. `card-library/DESIGN.md`: palette, typography, motion, capacity honesty,
   muted-logo treatment, gold-chip winner pattern.
3. `card-library/catalog.json`: machine-enforced per-card contracts
   (+ `structural` flag). Prefer encoding a lesson here over prose.
4. `lib/lint-cues.mjs`: quantitative selection rules (caps, spacing, zones,
   density) as named constants at the top of the file.
5. `tests/TESTS.md`: findings log, "Folded lessons" provenance, "Convergence"
   metrics (llm vs approved cue counts per video — watch `edited`/`typed` fall).
6. `steps/070-shot-pass-llm/RULEBOOK.md` + `shot-pass-prompt.md` (edit BOTH
   together) + `lib/lint-shots.mjs` constants: the avatar-span equivalents of
   1 and 4. The owner's standing avatar rules live here: ≤5 min total
   full-screen (hard), ≤5 min host-less cadence gaps, U-curve shape.

## Model routing (owner-decided, do not re-litigate)

- 020 cue pass: Sonnet (agy/Gemini approved as a free alternate to trial).
- 070 shot pass: Sonnet-class or better, run in-session via the `visuals-flow`
  skill (pilot ran on Fable 2026-07-18; it's form-filling like 020).
- 080 avatar submits: LIVE HeyGen, owner-run only, owner names the template
  slug (pilot: `girl-1`). HeyGen 3 only — the heygen-web hard rule.
- Novel-card authoring + card redesigns: Opus-class. Antigravity only under
  the recorded render-plus-visual-inspection mitigation (decisions.md 2026-07-07).
- **060 feedback-fold: Opus-class ONLY.** Trigger: owner says "fold the feedback".
- Plan execution (boss): default agy per `tooling/boss/data/rules.md`;
  claude-p sonnet for taste-judged/tricky. Visual output always rendered and
  inspected before landing.

## Immediate state of test-01

- cues.json: 18 cues, `approved: true`, rendered. v2→final owner edits are
  measurable via `node lib/edit-delta.mjs test-01` (baseline `cues.llm.json`).
- feedback.json: 9 items, all `applied` + `folded`. `feedback-status` exits 0.
- **Shot plan: 9 avatar-full spans, 247.7s/300s, lint clean, `approved: true`
  (2026-07-18). Owner approved the LLM output with ZERO edits** (shots.llm.json
  == shots.json — a perfect convergence data point).
- **Avatar submit ran 2026-07-18 late night**: `--template girl-1 --submit
  --spans-only` (owner call: full-screen spans only, corner track deferred).
  Check `videos/test-01/avatar-jobs.json` for ground truth. As of handoff
  writing: s01/s02/s04/s05 submitted with video_ids, **s03 FAILED (no
  video_id) — re-run submit to retry just s03** (idempotent), s06–s09 were
  still pacing through. Next actions, in order:
  1. Confirm all 9 jobs have video_ids (re-run submit for any failed).
  2. "download the avatar videos" (one attempt per pending job; re-run until
     no `pending:` lines) → clips in `~/kb-scratch/video/heygen/visuals-flow/test-01/`
     + `avatar-manifest.md`.
  3. Editor handoff: `renders/` + `manifest.md` + avatar clips +
     `avatar-manifest.md`; fold what comes back (GFX-06 gets its shape here).

## In flight

Plans 062–081 all boss-landed 2026-07-18 (PRs #19–#38; #38 = the
`visuals-flow` operating skill). At handoff-writing time the test-01 avatar
SUBMIT was still pacing through its jobs in a background shell — treat
`videos/test-01/avatar-jobs.json` as ground truth, not this doc.
Backlog registry: `plans/README.md` → "visuals-flow backlog" (GFX-01..06
hygiene) + "visuals-flow PRODUCT backlog" (GFX-07..13 roadmap).

## Open items (canonical list = GFX rows in plans/README.md)

1. **Finish the avatar pilot on test-01** (`GFX-07` machinery + skill are DONE;
   pilot ran 2026-07-18 late night): (a) confirm all 9 submits have video_ids
   in `avatar-jobs.json` — s03 failed on first pass, re-run submit to retry it;
   (b) "download the avatar videos" until no `pending:`; (c) corner track was
   DEFERRED by the owner (spans-only pilot) — revisit only when the owner asks.
2. **Editor handoff + feedback intake** (`GFX-06` open): give the editor
   `renders/` + `manifest.md` + avatar clips + `avatar-manifest.md`, fold what
   comes back.
3. **Global play-through on the board** (`GFX-08`, owner-deferred).
4. **agy cue-pass trial** (`GFX-11`): unblocked — lint is the objective rubric half.
5. **Density calibration**: not a task; the 060 fold loop + Convergence
   metrics do this across the first few real videos.
6. **Aesthetic visual QC beyond overflow** (`GFX-10`): open problem, revisit
   only with a cheap mechanism.
7. **edit-delta for shots** (`GFX-13`): fold into the first post-pilot touch
   (note: pilot v1 had ZERO owner edits, so there was nothing to diff yet).
