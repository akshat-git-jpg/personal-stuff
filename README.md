# personal-stuff

Single repo for personal projects, the tooling that lets Claude Code drive them, and the infra they run on. Most of it deploys to Cloudflare or a Hostinger VPS; the VPS pulls this repo on every cron tick, so paths here are load-bearing.

If you're orienting from scratch, read `INFRA.md` (what runs where) and `VPS-CRONS.md` (how the crons are wired) after this file.

## The map

The top level is grouped into buckets. Each bucket and most projects have their own README.

### `tooling/` — what lets Claude Code drive everything
- `claude-skills/` — Custom Claude Code skills. The single source; `scripts/relink.sh` symlinks them into both the work and personal accounts.
- `cli/` — Small command-line tools Claude calls instead of MCP servers: `gmail`, `sheets`, `youtube`, `hostinger`, `ntfy`, `rapidapi`, plus `yt-claude` and a ccusage dashboard. The active surface for Google/YouTube/Hostinger work.
- `mcp/` — MCP servers. Mostly legacy — only `drive` and `cloudflare` are still used. Shares Google OAuth with `cli/` through `mcp/google-shared` (kept a sibling of `cli/` so that relative path resolves). See `tooling/mcp/README.md`.

### `apps/` — personal apps
- `gym-app/` — Mobile gym PWA, live at `kushal-gym.agrolloo.com`. Vite + React + Hono on a Cloudflare Worker, backed by a Google Sheet.
- `kushal-docs/` — Personal document-vault PWA at `kushal-docs.agrolloo.com`. Upload/name/tag/filter PDFs + images. Vite + React + Hono on a Cloudflare Worker, files in R2, Google sign-in locked to one email.
- `personal-dashboard/` — Mobile dashboard PWA at `my-dashboard.agrolloo.com`, running as a Docker container on the VPS.
- `telegram-my-planner/` — Daily routine, to-do list, and exercise routine. Feeds the morning Telegram digest cron on the VPS.
- `telegram-email-assistant/` — Per-account Gmail digest preferences and `digest.sh` (runs on a VPS cron, sends to Telegram).

### `infra/`
- `docker/` — Compose files for the VPS containers (currently `ntfy`).
- `vps-watchdog/` — Cloudflare Worker on a 2-minute cron that pings the dashboard and reboots the VPS via the Hostinger API if it's down.
- `secrets/` — Local-only credentials. Gitignored, never committed.

### `learning/`
- `DSA/` — Data structures and algorithms practice: notes plus solutions, one folder per topic.

### Top level
- `scripts/` — Repo-wide orchestration (`relink.sh`, `regen-mcp-json.sh`) plus an index of everything outside the repo that depends on its layout. See `scripts/README.md`.
- `docs/` — Research notes and design specs.
- `.claude/` — Repo-level Claude settings (`settings.json`, `settings.local.json`).
- `INFRA.md` — Canonical inventory of Cloudflare + VPS + DNS.
- `VPS-CRONS.md` — Full cron architecture (Pattern B).

## Related

- Pinterest work lives in the **TY** repo: pin data and the funnel landing pages are under `TY/pinterest/` (`TY/pinterest/landing-pages/` holds the keto + bridebestie Cloudflare Workers). The Pinterest *skills* still live here in `tooling/claude-skills/`.

## Conventions

- `README.md` in a folder explains what it is, for a human. `CLAUDE.md` (where present) tells Claude how to operate in that folder.
- Folder names are kebab-case.
- `.mcp.json` is gitignored — it holds machine-absolute paths and is regenerated per machine by `scripts/regen-mcp-json.sh`.
- If you move or rename a folder, check `scripts/README.md` first — several things outside the repo hardcode these paths.
